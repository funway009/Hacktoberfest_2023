Guess the Number Game, By MOHAK AGRAWAL (github.com/manmohak07)

This is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number generated by the computer within a limited number of attempts.

The code is split into several sections:

Game Configuration
This code prompts the user to configure the difficulty by setting the maximum number to guess between, and the maximum number of guesses allowed.

Game Logic
The core game logic is handled here. A random number is generated, then a loop allows the user to make guesses until they guess correctly or run out of attempts. The number of guesses left is displayed each round.

Game Over
After the loop, the game over logic checks if the user guessed correctly or ran out of turns. It prints an appropriate end game message.

API Calls
The Numbers API is used to get interesting trivia about each guess number. This is called during the game, and the trivia is printed when the user guesses correctly.
